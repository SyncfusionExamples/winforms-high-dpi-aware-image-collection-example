# WinForms: DPI Aware Image Collection - Example

It helps the application to automatically switch images while operating on different DPI scaling machines. In this example, we used our Syncfusion Ribbon control as a model and mapped image of the Syncfusion ImageListAdv component for illustration purpose.
